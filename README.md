## [Kaleido-BERT: Vision-Language Pre-training on Fashion Domain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07663.pdf)
by Mingchen Zhuge^, Dehong Gao^, Deng-Ping Fan#, Linbo Jin, Ben Chen, Minghui Qiu, Ling Shao.

## Code
This project is built on [Huggingface(pytorch)](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) while the raw implementation of paper is built on [EasyTransfer(tensorflow)](https://github.com/alibaba/EasyTransfer). So there may have some differences when conduct this code.
